
R scripts to produce the nutrient (phosphate, iron) specific gene regulatory network in Arabidopsis from multiple (partial) evidences (nutrient specific coexpression, root stress differential coexpression and transcription factor binding), as presented in: "ASRK1 activates TORC1 signaling to adjust growth to phosphate availability in Arabidopsis", Current Biology, 2023 (in press)

(Note: To recreate exact network layouts from inferred gene regulatory network (stored in "df.grn_w_specificity.csv"), use defined dependency versions, i.e. R: v3.6.2, 
igraph: v1.2.6.)
